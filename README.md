# Java Programming Practice

This repository contains Java programs that I wrote while learning Java in my university courses and from my own practice.  
It covers a wide range of basic to intermediate topics that I studied mostly in my 2nd and 3rd semesters.

---

## What’s Inside?

Here you’ll find programs related to these important Java topics:

- Basic Syntax and Data Types  
- Control Statements (`if`, `switch`, loops)  
- Arrays (single and multi-dimensional)  
- ArrayList and LinkedList  
- HashMap and HashSet  
- Exception Handling (try-catch-finally)  
- File Input/Output  
- Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:  
  - Classes and Objects  
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Abstraction

## File Names & Structure

I tried to name files clearly so you can understand what the program is about just by looking at the name.

For example:

- BasicCalculator.java` — Simple calculator using basic control statements  
- ArrayExample.java` — Working with arrays  
- LinkedListDemo.java` — Basic LinkedList operations  
- HashMapExample.java` — Using HashMap for storing key-value pairs  
- ExceptionHandlingDemo.java` — Examples of try-catch blocks  
- FileReadWrite.java` — Reading and writing files in Java  
- OOPConceptsDemo.java` — Shows classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.


## How to Run

You can run these Java programs using any IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code.

## Why This Repository?
I made this repository mainly to keep track of my learning and practice with Java.
If you are learning Java, feel free to use these programs, learn from them, or improve them.

## About Me
I’m Nayem Uddin, a Computer Science and Engineering student currently in my 3rd semester.
I started learning Java in my 2nd semester, and this repo contains all my practice projects so far.
